-   ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tural Sadigov, Visiting Assistant Professor of
    Mathematics and Statistics at Hamilton College.

-   ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Statatistics, Machine Learning and Data
    Science.

-   ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently teaching various topics in Statistics, Data Science
    and Machine Learning, and doing research in the combination of
    Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning.

Teaching is my passion, and I believe that better teacher is one that
can break highly complex topics into bits and make them intuitive for
the learners.
